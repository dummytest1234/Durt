# Comments by Ming
* Push notifications can come last.
* Server and FB login seem top priority
* From your status report 2: "Storing user data entered on different pages (username, password, plants) into one collection" => yeesh, separation of concerns: not ideal to lump user data with plants
* I know this team worked very hard throughout project.
