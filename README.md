# comp20-f2017-team10

### Project title
	Durt

### Problem statement
	It can be hard to grow and manage your garden if you don't know much about plants.

### Solving the problem
	We provide you with information pertaining to the plants you grow (information about the plant, when to water, when to harvest, etc.) and the weather conditions in your area.

### Features to be implemented
	Pick Three
		Geolocation (determine your location for weather purposes, analytics about what's being grown around you)
		Server-side data persistence (stores information about user's garden)
		Send emails/SMS (send you notifications when it's time to water/harvest/etc. your plants)

### Data to be used and collected
	Username & password
	Types of plants
	Location
	When plant was planted
	When plant was harvested
	Weather

### Algorithms/special techniques
	Median finding algorithm (to find ideal growing conditions based on data collected from user)
